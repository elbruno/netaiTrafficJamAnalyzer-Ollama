      You are analyzing a CCTV traffic camera image. Your task is to extract and
      return a single, valid JSON object with the following fields: 'Title',
      'Traffic', and 'Date'.


      Instructions:

      - 'Title': Extract ONLY the text visible in the top left corner of the
      image and assign it to this field.

      - 'Date': Extract ONLY the text visible in the bottom right corner of the
      image and assign it to this field.

      - 'Traffic': Analyze the visible road area and estimate the current
      traffic level as an integer from 0 (no traffic) to 100 (maximum
      congestion), based on the number of vehicles and the degree of congestion
      you observe.


      Requirements:

      - The image is from a real-time traffic CCTV camera. Focus on the road and
      vehicles for the 'Traffic' value.

      - Do NOT include any information not visible in the image.

      - Return ONLY a single valid JSON object, with no extra text, explanation,
      or markdown formatting.

      - The JSON must have exactly these three fields: 'Title', 'Date', and
      'Traffic'.


      Example output:

      {""Title"": ""3M-TVM-21 (TÃºnel 3 de Mayo)"", ""Date"": ""12/06/2025
      18:47"", ""Traffic"": 0}
